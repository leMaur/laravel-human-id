This package has been inspired by the article "Designing APIs for humans: Object IDs" appeared on [Dev](https://dev.to/stripe/designing-apis-for-humans-object-ids-3o5a) (Aug 30, 2022 / by [Paul Asjes](https://dev.to/paulasjes)).

I really like the approach Stripe uses to define the object ID, so I figured out how to make something similar for Laravel.  
Basically, the package generate a so-called "human id" by prepending a prefix to a ULID with a separator between them.

An example should be better than a thousand words...

```md
üëá the structure -----------------

{prefix}{separator}{ulid}


üëá the params --------------------

prefix: post
separator: _
ulid: 26 alphanumeric characters


üëá the result --------------------

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require lemaur/laravel-human-id
```

<br>

## Usage

1. Add the "human ID" field in your migration files.    
2. Import the `Lemaur\HumanId\Concerns\HasHuids` trait into your eloquent model.

Here's a real-life example of how to implement the trait on a model.

```php
// database\migrations\create_posts_table.php

use Illuminate\Database\Migrations\Migration;
use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;

return new class extends Migration
{
    public function up(): void
    {
        Schema::create('posts', static function (Blueprint $table) {
            $table->id();
            
            $table->huid(); // <-- declare "huid" field
            
            // other fields...
        });
    }
}
```

```php
// app\Models\Post.php

namespace App\Models;

use \Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use \Lemaur\HumanId\Concerns\HasHuids;

class Post extends Model
{
    use HasHuids; // <-- import trait
    
    /** @var string */
    private const HUID_PREFIX = 'post'; // <-- declare prefix (max 4 characters length)
}

// this will generate a huid like --> post_01h554vp2prg6zfayagh83ccx7
```

<br>

## Configuration

You can use a different name for the field (currently is "huid") and the separator character (currently is "_").  
To do that, you should publish the configuration file and change them from there.

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=human-id-config
```

## Testing

```bash
composer test
```
